# PART 1 - FUNCTIONS PRACTICE (Pure Python)

# 1. Write a function called shout that takes in a string
# as an argument and returns it in all capital letters
# Hint: Visit https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_string.asp
def shout(string):
    # pass is a placeholder for future code
    # it can be used to avoid getting errors
    pass

# call the function to test it out!


# 2. Write a function called whisper that takes in a string
# as an argument and returns it in all lowercase letters



# call the function to test it out!



# 3. Write a function called how_many_letters that takes in
# a string as an argument and returns the number of letters in
# that string


# 4. Write a function that calculates the area of a rectangle
# Bonus: Build in a way to detect if the rectangle is a square



# 5. Write a function to determine whether a number is even or odd



# 6. Write a function to convert a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit



# 7. STRETCH: Refactor (reorganize) your temperature conversion
# function such that it can convert temps from C to F or F to C
# Hint: There are many possible solutions, but consider using input()
# to help you get started!

# PART 2 - FUNCTIONS X EARSKETCH

setTempo(120)

# 1. Create a function called playSounds() that plays at least 2 different
# sounds on different tracks in the DAW for at least 4 measures

def playSounds():
    pass

# test your playSounds() function by calling it



# 2. Refactor your playSounds() function so that it takes in a 
# measure argument that indicates what measure the sounds will
# start and stopplaying - for example: a call of playSounds(1, 5) would 
# begin playing the sounds in measure 1 and end after measure 4



# test your refactored function by calling it



# 3. STRETCH: Create a playChorus() function that plays the chorus of 
# a song in the EarSketch sound library. Choose an artist that you like
# and examine the sounds that have "chorus" in their name. Try to piece
# together components of that song's chorus (vocals, piano, drums, etc)
# so that it plays cohesively when the function is called!
# Optional: give your function parameters like measure, tempo, etc. to
# make it even more flexible



# test your playChorus() function by calling it!
